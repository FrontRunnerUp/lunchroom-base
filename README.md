# Lunchroom base project

This project was first forked off angular-seed, as per the instruction provided in their [README] (https://github.com/angular/angular-seed#angular-seed--the-seed-for-angularjs-apps), particularly the following part:


> If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git <your-project-name>
```
> The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.
